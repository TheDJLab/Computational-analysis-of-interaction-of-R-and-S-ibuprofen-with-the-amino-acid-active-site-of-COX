# Computational-analysis-of-interaction-of-R-and-S-ibuprofen-with-the-amino-acid-active-site-of-COX
This repository contains all materials needed to reproduce and further analyze the results of our computational experiment between R/S-ibuprofen and the active sites of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes. In this experiment we used molecular docking to find the active sites of the COX isoenzymes, which were then used in further analysis to determine the interaction energies between R/S-ibuprofen, with each individual amino acid within the COX active site. The purpose of this experiment was to further understand the interaction between ibuprofen and the COX isoenzymes, with a goal to synthesize a more COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
